# Weather API ‚Äì Software Engineer Case Study

A backend application built with Fastify and TypeScript. It allows users to register, authenticate, and query current weather data by city using the OpenWeather API. Results are cached in Redis for performance and scalability.

## Technologies Used

- **Fastify** (lightweight web framework)
- **TypeScript**
- **Prisma** (ORM)
- **PostgreSQL**
- **Redis** (for caching)
- **JWT** (for authentication)
- **OpenWeather API**
- **Postman** (for testing)
- **GitHub Actions** (for CI testing pipeline)

## Role-based Access

The application supports two roles:

- `USER`: Can only view their own weather queries.
- `ADMIN`: Can view all weather queries made by all users.

Roles are assigned during registration via `"role": "USER"` or `"role": "ADMIN"` field.
